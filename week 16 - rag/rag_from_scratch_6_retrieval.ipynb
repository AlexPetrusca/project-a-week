    "\n",
    "Retrieval is a critical step in RAG pipelines. If the retriever fails to surface relevant documents, the generation stage will be starved of the context it needs — even if the answer exists somewhere in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "User query:\n",
    "- “Can I bring my dog on the plane?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "- The relevant document says: “Small pets are allowed in the cabin if kept in an airline-approved carrier.”\n",
    "- The word “dog” never appears — only “pets” or “animals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Failure:\n",
    "- A naive retriever might not consider “dog” and “pet” semantically similar.\n",
    "- The relevant document is not retrieved, even though it answers the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "- The LLM, lacking the key passage, responds: “I couldn’t find any information about dogs on the plane.”\n",
    "- Users perceive this as a model failure, but the real issue was the retriever’s blind spot."

    "- **Re-Rank**: Score and reorder initially retrieved documents using a query-document relevance model (e.g., a cross-encoder).\n",
    "- **RankGPT**: Use a language model itself to rank candidate documents by how well they answer the query — using generation and reasoning rather than embeddings.\n",
    "- **RAG-Fusion**: Run multiple diverse queries (original + variations) through the retriever, then fuse the results for better coverage (we covered this in \"query translation\")."
