    "RAG systems rely on effective indexing. Weak indexing can bury relevant content, omit key context, or fragment meaning—leading to incomplete or misleading results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "- The document containing the answer says: “Click ‘Forgot Password’ on the login screen.”\n",
    "- But the phrase “reset your password” doesn't appear anywhere in the text.\n",

    "Potential bad outcome:\n",
    "- The retriever misses the relevant document.\n",
    "- The LLM responds: “Sorry, I couldn’t find anything about that,” even though the answer exists in the corpus."
