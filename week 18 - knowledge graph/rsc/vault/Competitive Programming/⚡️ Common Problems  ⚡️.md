‚≠êÔ∏è **Tip**: Think out-loud while solving problems. This will help you talk during interviews (and make your problem-solving better overall).
‚≠êÔ∏è **Tip**: If stuck, consider the problem without constraints and then with constraints.
‚≠êÔ∏è **Tip**: If stuck, draw step-by-step diagrams where indices are labelled.
ü™≤ **Debug**: If wrong code but right idea, check all of the assumptions your code makes line by line to spot the bug.
‚úçÔ∏è **Memorize**: Binary Search, DFS, Partition, Merge, Backtracking
ü§î **Remember**: QuickSort, QuickSelect, BFS, Bottom-Up DP, Array Rotation
üò° **Avoid**: Over-communicating, Rambling, Not reading the problem, Starting the problem without thinking it out (CALM DOWN)

### 4 Step Plan to Solving an Interview Question

1.  Think
2.  Verify
3.  Write
4.  Revise

### 5 Problem Solving Tips for Cracking Coding Interview Questions

1.  Find a brute force solution
2.  Think of simpler version of the problem
3.  Think with simple examples ‚Äî> Try noticing a pattern
4.  Use some visualization
5.  Test your solution on a few examples

### Recursion Tips

True for call stack and call tree:
- You can pass down a mutable, ‚Äúcollector‚Äù object reference via parameter (ArrayList reference)
- You can pass down data via parameters
- You can pass up data via returns

True exclusively for call stack:
- You can do processing going up & down the stack

True exclusively recursive call tree:
- You can compare returns from the right, left, and crossover (divide and conquer)
- You can do pre-order, in-order, & post-order processing
